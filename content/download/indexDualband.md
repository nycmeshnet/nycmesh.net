Please read our [FAQ](../faq) if you haven't already.

**Join the mesh**  
First you need to enter a [new node request](../join). This will add your router to our list of node requests and put your location on our map. If you have multiple locations enter them separately.

**Order a router**    
We currently support three different models of routers- 

For outdoors and long distance-  

* Ubiquiti NSM5 directional 5GHz (~$95 including tax)

For indoors-  

* TP-Link dual-band TL-WDR3600(~$55)
* TP-Link TL-WR842ND 2.4GHz (~$33)

A dual-band router can mesh over-the-air (or by ethernet) with both the Ubiquiti and other TP-Links. The single band router can  mesh over-the-air with other TP-Links, and it can connect to the Ubiquiti via ethernet cable.

We've had a few nodes go offline because of interference. Working through some of those now. Some nodes might get stuck offline for a more extended time as we must not interfere. We'll have to fix those after we fix all interference issues.

Heavy rain has been interrupting our Henry and Rivington connections downtown. This affects most nodes that are **not** directly connected to Supernode 1. We are planning a fix for this but it will take a few weeks to implement.

Saratoga Hub is still having bandwidth issues. We are about halfway through fixing this. There is now a fast connection from Soft Surplus to Saratoga. Next we have to upgrade the main router and also add a second West-facing sector antenna. This should all be completed over the next 4 weeks.

_Recently our Supernode 2 had to be taken down for roof repair which forced us to make major changes to the area's network. We are still working on improving the new connections. The good news is many new hub nodes are coming online, so there will be more choices to connect to in the coming weeks._

Antenna alignment today at Ehud to fix ongoing bandwidth problem at Saratoga in Brooklyn. Bandwidth should improve in the afternoon after a short downtime around noon.

Rivington hub is still in process of upgrades. This is affecting 4 active nodes in the Lower East Side. We are planning to get full bandwidth there next week by connecting to Henry hub and SN1 using new gigabit 60Ghz gear.

_Recently our Supernode 2 had to be taken down for roof repair which forced us to make major changes to the area's network. We are still working on improving the new connections. The good news is many new hub nodes are coming online, so there will be more choices to connect to in the coming weeks._

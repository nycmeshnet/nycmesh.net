**Due to nearly everyone working from home, our bandwidth usage has doubled and most connections are much slower than usual.**

This is especially affecting connections to the PH and Saratoga hubs in Brooklyn. We are working on a software fix and eventual hardware upgrades for this but it will take time. 

**We ask that you limit high-bandwidth downloads (such as games or movie files) to between midnight and 10am.**

_Recently our Supernode 2 had to be taken down for roof repair which forced us to make major changes to the area's network. We are still working on improving the new connections. The good news is many new hub nodes are coming online, so there will be more choices to connect to in the coming weeks._

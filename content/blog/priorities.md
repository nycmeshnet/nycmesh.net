Here is my list of priorities for the mesh in order of importance. I'll keep this updated.

**1. Increase install rate**  
**2. Work and storage space**  
**3. Software services**  
**4. OpenWrt compatible 802.11ac**  
**5. Tall structure installs**  
**6. Collaborations**  
**7. Donations**

**1. Increase install rate**

We have over a thousand people waiting for installs. We need to drastically increase the install rate by having multiple install team coordinators. In the short term we want to increase the rate from a few a week to two per day. With multiple teams we should be able to get this to five per day.

**2. Work and storage space**

We need a place to store our install gear and also work on routers etc.

**3. Software services**

The mesh network has around 5 small servers that can be accessed using our ".mesh" domain. This has been difficult to maintain. We do have IRC installed and running across three servers but it is rarely used. We need distributed software that will still work when servers are down or part of the network is not accessible. Guifi has a package called [Cloudy](http://cloudy.community/) that I would like to try.

**4. OpenWrt compatible 802.11ac**

We need to start using gigabit 802.11ac routers for speed. We are currently looking at the indoor [GL-B1300](https://www.gl-inet.com/b1300/). For outdoor we don't have any 802.11ac that supports OpenWrt

**5.Tall structure installs**

Tall structures are the only way we can expand the wireless mesh. This is by far our biggest priority. There are a few different types in the city and we need to try them all- NYCHA buildings, skyscrapers, churches, schools, libraries, existing antenna masts and building coops. We need specific presentations and handouts for each of these types of structures. We are currently approaching libraries and [churches](/leaflet/church.pdf). We need to build presentations for coop boards and others.

Once we have a tall structure in a neighborhood we can link to apartment building rooftops.

**6. Collaborations**

We are just starting some exciting collaborations with Zoetic Networks and Brooklyn Microgrid, and we are in talks with Chinatown B.I.D and NYCHA. This is essential to our growth and we should have more of this.

**7. Donations**

Donations and subscriptions are support the cost for supernode1. We need more money to help us create more supernodes and expand. You can donate via our [donate page.](/donate).

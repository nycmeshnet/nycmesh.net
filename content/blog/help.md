[We now have a dedicated page for volunteer help](/volunteer)

Here is the older blog post-

**Ways you can help us:**

First [join our slack](https://join.slack.com/t/nycmesh/shared_invite/enQtNDk0NDA4OTAyNDY0LTU5NWMyODY5ZTYyMDY2NzgzOTJmZjFmZTg3YWRjYjE0M2EyMzlhNDE3YmIxZmZhYTZmNjIwNTVkMDIwMjI2ZDg) group. Then pick something from the list below-

**Installers**

We need to organize an install team. The involves climbing on roofs, drilling holes, running ethernet cable, crimping cable, antenna alignment, antenna channel selection. Join the [#installs](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/installs) channel.

**Install Planning**

We have hundreds of node applications. See if you can join the rooftops together on our [map](/map/) and plan an install. This takes lots of emailing and phone calls. Join the [#installs](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/installs) channel.

**Network Admins**

Help us by monitoring nodes and alerting users to problems. Do you know Icinga or Nagios? Know how to write bash scripts? Join the [#monitoring](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/monitoring) channel

**Neighborhood Organizers**

Distribute leaflets and help organize events in your neighborhood. Get your local community centers involved. Join the [#neighborhoods](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/neighborhoods) channel

**Neighborhood internet gateway**

Set up a node on your rooftop to share your internet gateway. Join the [#neighborhoods](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/neighborhoods) channel

**Hardware hackers**

Get our firmware running on more devices. We need support for cheap 2.4GHz and dual band routers. Join the [#hardware](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/hardware) and [#software](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/software) channels on Slack. Clone our [nycmeshfeed](https://github.com/nycmeshnet/nycmeshfeed) on our [github](https://github.com/nycmeshnet).

**Donate Space**

We need a space to store cable and antennas and prepare installs.

**Grant writing**

Our very successful grant writer is leaving the country. We need someone to look up appropriate grants and write the applications. Join the #funding channel.

**Donate Money**

[Donations](/donate/) are tax deductible and go towards expanding our network!

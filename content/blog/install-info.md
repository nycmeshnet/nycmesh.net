We have a few different types of install. At the moment we are mostly doing installs in downtown Manhattan that connect directly to the supernode- a "supernode client install"

With all rooftop installs, an antenna is mounted on the roof and an ethernet cable goes down a wall or conduit and into your apartment. We usually put the cable through a window frame or at the side of an air-conditioner. A small power adapter in your apartment will give power the antenna over the ethernet cable. Another router is needed in the apartment for your wifi connection.

DIY installs are possible, or you can pay us $110 to cover hardware (basically cost) and $50 labor for an installer. Email us if you would prefer a monthly plan rather than upfront payment.

**1) Supernode client**

You need to be within about two miles of the Wall St. area. We can usually tell by a panorama pic whether this install will work for you.

***Equipment needed***-

We supply the LiteBeamAC, antenna mount (if needed), ethernet, ethernet switch (if needed) and indoor router.

The total for the equipment is [$110](/donate/), and the install is $50 (paid to an independent installer).

$160 per apartment is due on the day of the install. We also suggest a monthly subscription of $20 to help us maintain our network.

It is possible to do this yourself. Ask us for help configuring the LiteBeamAC. If you are installing in a window we suggest the much smaller NanoBeamAC 16.


**2) Kiosk client install**

This is similar to supernode client but uses a NanoStation aimed at a LinkNYC kiosk on the avenue below.

We supply the NanoStation NSM5, antenna mount (if needed), ethernet, ethernet switch (if needed) and indoor router.

The total for the equipment is [$110](/donate/), and the install is $50 (paid to an independent installer).

$160 per apartment is due on the day of the install. We also suggest a monthly subscription of $20 to help us maintain our network.

If you want to try this yourself read this [blog post](/blog/public-access-points).

**3) Building to building**

This is similar to supernode client but uses NanoStation M5 connected to a nearby established neighborhood network. We supply the NanoStation NSM5, antenna mount (if needed), ethernet, ethernet switch (if needed) and indoor router.

$160 per apartment is due on the day of the install. We also suggest a monthly subscription of $20 to help us maintain our network.

For DIY NanoStation installs [download our firmware](/download) and read our [install instructions](https://docs.nycmesh.net/installs/nsm5/).

**4) Point to point**

Email us directly for details on a point to point connection. This can be as fast as a gigabit, but requires dedicated hardware. We can also wire the entire building with ethernet to provide all residents with a connection. Hardware can be as little as $130 for two LiteBeams or $3000 for a pair of gigabit AirFiber.

The COVID-19 pandemic has upended the way we live, work and learn, and access to the internet has been critical to staying in touch with family, doing our jobs from home and continuing to attend school. At NYC Mesh our volunteers have been working hard to improve connectivity for our existing members, help new members set up their own DIY installs, run virtual training sessions and pursue new  partnerships with allied organizations.

I talked to two of our most active volunteers, Zach and Rohan, about how they’ve been contributing to NYC Mesh during the crisis.

WB: What motivates you to be part of NYC Mesh and have those motivations changed since COVID-19?

ZG: We’ve always been trying to build this community network and connect the unconnected. Where other organizations don’t care about bringing connectivity, we can bring it. So the motivation remains the same. However there’s a realization that with Coronavirus there are areas that didn’t have internet before and it may not have been critical to people’s lives before but now it is because their kids can’t get online to stay in school, that kind of stuff.

Here's a list of our reasons for building a community-owned mesh network:

* Self configuring (simple!)
* Emergency community networking (for next hurricane)
* Freedom from the telecom oligopoly of Time Warner, Verizon, Comcast
* A neutral network that does not block or discriminate content
* No personal data collection
* Public wifi access points
* Decentralized, no single point of failure
* Community building with highly localized websites
* Close the digital divide
* Potentially higher symmetrical bandwidth than provided by the oligopoly
* Creating an infrastructure commons. The community owns the network.
* Eventual self-sufficient network as alternative to internet

Allow us to welcome you to our very own corner of the Internet! This website will be where any official news and information will be posted.

With several people having purchased nanostations and others showing interest, it seems to be time to organize another meetup. Details will be posted here once they're finalized.

In the meantime, if you have any questions or just want to say hello, join us on IRC on __#nycmeshnet on EFnet__ ([web client](https://chat.efnet.org:9090/?channels=#nycmeshnet)). Don't feel bad if no one responds right away; someone will eventually respond!

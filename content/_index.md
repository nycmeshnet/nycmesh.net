The Internet is central to our lives. But in New York City, our access is controlled by a cartel of cable companies who overcharge and underdeliver.

We are a diverse group of people living in New York who decided to set up our own network, NYC Mesh, to bypass the cable cartel and connect directly to the Internet backbone. We now get Internet that's cheaper, faster and more secure, and our network is supported by a community of dedicated volunteers.

NYC Mesh connects apartments, small businesses, schools and entire buildings to the Internet using wireless routers and fiber. These individual "nodes" connect to "hubs" and "supernodes," where we have specialized gear to keep our network running even through emergencies. We are a neutral network and do not monitor, collect, store or block any user data or content.

The Internet is central to our lives, but in New York City far too many people don’t have access.

We are a diverse group of volunteers dedicated to ending the digital divide and extending  high-speed, reliable internet to all New Yorkers. You can help by joining our community network to get online, volunteering to connect neighbors or grow the network, and donating to improve our community infrastructure and ensure access for all.

NYC Mesh is a neutral network and we do not monitor, collect, store or block any user data or content. By joining our network you agree to extend it to others!

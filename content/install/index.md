title: "Install Info"

We have a few different types of installs. At the moment, we are mostly installing supernode and hub clients in downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn.

With all rooftop installs, an antenna is mounted on the roof and outdoor ethernet cable goes down a wall or conduit and into your apartment. We usually put the cable through a window frame or next to an air conditioner. A small adapter in your apartment will power the rooftop antenna over this ethernet cable. Another router is needed in the apartment for your wifi connection.

DIY installs are possible, or you can pay us $110 to cover hardware and $50 to an installer for their labor. [Email us](mailto:contact@nycmesh.net) if you would prefer a monthly plan rather than upfront payment.

### 1) Supernode or Hub Client

You need to have line of sight and be within about two miles of a supernode or hub node, like [Supernode 1](/map/nodes/227) or [Node 1340](/map/nodes/1340). We can usually tell by a panorama pic whether this install will work for you.

We supply the LiteBeamAC, antenna mount (if needed), outdoor ethernet cable, ethernet switch (if needed) and indoor router.

The total for the equipment is [$110](/pay/), and the install is $50 (paid to an independent installer).

$160 per apartment is due on the day of the install. We also suggest a monthly subscription of $20 to help us maintain our network.

It is possible to do this yourself. Ask us for help configuring the LiteBeamAC. If you are installing in a window we suggest the much smaller NanoBeamAC 16. If you DIY please consider also connecting your neighbors. This is the whole point of the mesh.

### 2) Kiosk Client

These are similar to supernode or hub clients but use a [Mikrotik SXT](https://docs.nycmesh.net/hardware/sxtsqg5acd/) aimed at a LinkNYC kiosk on the street below.

We supply the antenna, mount (if needed), ethernet, ethernet switch (if needed) and indoor router.

The total for the equipment is [$110](/pay/), and the install is $50 (paid to an independent installer).

$160 per apartment is due on the day of the install. We also suggest a monthly subscription of $20 to help us maintain our network.

If you want to try this yourself read this this [blog post](/blog/public-access-points) and this [docs page](https://docs.nycmesh.net/installs/linknyc/).

### 3) Building to Building

These are similar to supernode or hub clients but use a NanoStation M5 to connected to a existing nearby node. We supply the antenna, antenna mount (if needed), ethernet, ethernet switch (if needed) and indoor router.

The total for the equipment is [$110](/pay/), and the install is $50 (paid to an independent installer).

$160 per apartment is due on the day of the install. We also suggest a monthly subscription of $20 to help us maintain our network.

For DIY NanoStation installs [download our firmware](/download) and read our [install instructions](https://docs.nycmesh.net/installs/nsm5/).

### 4) Point to Point

[Email us](mailto:contact@nycmesh.net) directly for details on a point to point connection. This can be as fast as a gigabit, but requires dedicated hardware. We can also wire the entire building with ethernet to provide all residents with a connection. Hardware can be as little as $130 for two LiteBeams or $3000 for a pair of gigabit AirFiber.

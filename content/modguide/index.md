This guide documents protocols for moderators on how to respond to reports of conduct violations, the expectations of our moderators, and how to become a moderator.

## Responding to a Code of Conduct report

If someone reports unacceptable behavior, ask for a written account of what happened.
This should be kept confidential to as small a group as reasonably possible, and potentially anonymised by the receiving person before distribution to the closed group.
If organizers receive a verbal report, they should themselves write down what they were told as soon as they can.
If a report is made anonymously without an email address provided for follow-up, or if the reporter indicates that they do not give us permission to act on their report, we will unfortunately not be able to take any action.

Within two business days of receiving a report, you will complete the following steps.

### First Steps

If the following information is not volunteered in a report, ask for it/include it, but do not pressure anyone:
* Identifying information of the participant doing the harassing
* The behavior that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made)
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Other people involved in the incident

### Determine whether a violation occurred

Review the details of the report, and read the Code of Conduct.
You must be able to specifically reference a behavior documented in the Code of Conduct.
* If not, reply to the reporter, explain that our code of conduct was not violated, and suggest other remediation options (e.g. getting advice on how to resolve an interpersonal conflict).
* If yes, determine whether you are the best person to respond to the situation, or if it is more appropriate to hand off the report to another moderator (for example, if someone else already has a relationship with the reporter or the accused).

### Follow up with the reporter

When a report has been received:
* Email the reporter to acknowledge that we’ve received the report, and are taking action
* Ask any follow-up questions we need to better understand the situation
* Confirm with the reporter whether we can contact the accused individual


### Follow up with the violator

In the event that we have permission from the reporter to contact the violator:
* Reach out to the member over email, let them know that we’ve received a report of a code of conduct violation, and invite them to speak to us about the incident in person if possible, over video chat if not.
* If you determine that a code of conduct violation has occurred, explain to the member how it affected our community, and what the appropriate consequence is.

## Becoming a moderator

We welcome anyone to become a moderator!

Because moderators work with sensitive information, we do require some education and training. In particular this includes reading and being familiar with the Code of Conduct.

If you are interested in becoming a moderator, please ping the `@moderators` slack group, and someone will be in touch!

### Responsibilities

Moderators should first and foremost ensure the privacy of all community members.
This means not sharing any details of interpersonal conflict in public.
All reports should be handled with the narrowest scope possible.

For this reason, we have created a private #mods channel for discussing the details of a report.

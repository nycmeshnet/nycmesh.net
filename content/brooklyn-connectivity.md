title: "Brooklyn Connectivity Issues"
---

Sorry, we are having ongoing problems in Brooklyn. Our Supernode 2 had to be taken down for roof repair which forced us to make major changes to the area's network.There is more work being done today (October 17) that should improve speeds all around. We will need to go offline for an hour or so while this is configured.

The good news is many new hub nodes are coming online, so there will be more choices to connect to in the coming weeks.

If you are experiencing issues with your connection, please create a [support ticket](/support) or contact us on [slack](https://slack.nycmesh.net) in the #support channel.

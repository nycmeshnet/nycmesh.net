Thanks for your interest in becoming a member of NYC Mesh. NYC Mesh is a nonprofit that's been run entirely by volunteers, providing a community network and internet connectivity to thousands of people across NYC since 2014.

Volunteers finished connecting The Olmsted to NYC Mesh in 2024, and any resident can now get connected and optionally replace their existing internet service.

## How does it work?
If you haven't already, fill out the Join form at https://nycmesh.net/join. A volunteer will then take that information and reach out to you to find a time to perform the installation. After the installation is complete, you will be walked through the payment process

## How much does it cost?
As a special deal for Olmsted, NYC Mesh asks for a $220 tax-deductible donation to cover the cost of the installation equipment, and an optional but recommended monthly bill of $30 afterwards. This can be paid for all at once with almost any payment method, or can be paid on a monthly basis with a credit card.

NYC Mesh also requests a $50 cash tip for the installer to cover their expenses, tools, etc.

To summarize, the cost is:

- $270 due on the day of installation
- $30 per month afterwards, billed automatically

## How does the install work?
A volunteer will arrive at the building a couple hours before your arranged time to configure equipment in the basement and run a cable through the building's hallway. The volunteer will then coordinate with you to find an appropriate location for the equipment inside your unit, preferably near the entrance where a power outlet is available. The volunteer then drills a small hole through the wall to run the hallway cable into your unit and will connect your equipment. You can then connect to the internet and verify connectivity. At that point the volunteer will request payment for the installation.

## Do I need a Router? What about WiFi?
The install includes a WiFi 6 Router that is managed by Mesh.  This single device takes the fiber connection and provides WiFi to your apartment.

## Is it safe?
The included router has a firewall so your devices are isolated from the rest of the mesh.  This will give you security similar to what you will get from from a provider like Verizon where you rent their router.  If you would like additional security or additional features above this you can always use your own firewall/router and the mesh device can be put into bridge mode.

## What is the speed?
The standard install is 1Gbps for upload and download.

## What about Cable TV / Phone?
This service is for internet only.  You can stream TV by using services such as Roku, Hulu, etc. using your NYC Mesh connection but they are independent from Mesh itself.

## How does support work?
NYC Mesh has a robust volunteer support community, reachable in a variety of methods. The primary method of getting support is to visit https://www.nycmesh.net/support which has up-to-date contact information. There you and find the NYC Mesh Support phone number, email address, and more.

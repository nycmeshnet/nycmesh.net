title: "Can I use my own different router?"
---
No, the router we currently support and recommend for building-to-building is the Ubiquiti NanoStation M5. For supernode connections you will need a LiteBeamAC or NanoBeamAC router. Our [download page](/download) has our firmware for the NanoStation and links to buy. We are working on supporting other routers. 

TP-Link have locked down some of their routers, and others are not supported well by OpenWrt, so we unfortunately are looking at other options for indoor routers at the moment.

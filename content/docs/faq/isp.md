title: "Are you an Internet Service Provider (ISP)?"
---
No, we are not an ISP, we are a community that shares ownership of a network. Collectively we have our own internet connection at our "supernode". Also some of our members share their own internet connections. 

Our supernode peers with other networks at an internet exchange point and provides access to the internet without traditional ISPs. We are a non-profit project of the New York chapter of the Internet Society (ISOC-NY).

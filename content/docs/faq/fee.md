title: "Is there a monthly fee?"

Once you buy a router and install it you are part of NYC Mesh. There is no compulsory fee. Donations help us cover maintenance. By joining the mesh you are obliged to share and extend the mesh in the same way that it was shared with you.

If you are benefitting from the network, or you would like to help us extend the network, please pay a small monthly donation. If you cannot afford this, we understand!

We also do installs for entire buildings and set up high-bandwidth point-to-point connections with dedicated hardware. If your building would like this dedicated service please [email us](mailto:install@nycmesh.net) or call us at \(646\) 727-0866. Using this service can replace your current ISP for very large buildings.

title: "Why don't we mesh mobile phones instead of routers?"
---

There is "mesh" software for mobile phones such as Serval and FireChat. This is mainly used for chat messages. It stores the messages until a phone is within range and then transfers the data. Mobile "mesh" networks are very low bandwidth, not real-time and require many phones in a small area. They are great for events or some emergency situations.

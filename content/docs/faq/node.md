title: "What is a node?"
---
A node is a location with one or more routers or antennas, i.e. it is usually a dot on our map. Some dots have multiple apartments with installs in the same building so that would be one node per apartment. A supernode will have multiple radios, routers, antennas and maybe a server too.

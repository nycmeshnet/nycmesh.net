title: "What software/firmware do you use?"
---
We are using an OpenWrt package made by qMp. This uses the BMX6 mesh protocol. We have added tinc tunneling so a router can mesh over the internet when out of range using a secure virtual private network (VPN). 

Our point-to-point connections use factory firmware such as AirOS. The supernode is running Linux with Quagga and BGP. For network monitoring we use Nagios and Icinga2.

We also have some members experimenting with and contributing to cjdns/hyperboria software. Let us know if you are interested in this.

title: "Is the mesh secure?"
---

If you use the internet while on the mesh, you should use standard precautions such as using https (lock icon) web sites for secure connections, or use a VPN service.

By default, our mesh router is firewalled from your local network. It is not possible to reach beyond the mesh router to your LAN. Mesh tunneling over the internet is by tinc VPN and is secure. Network traffic within the mesh is not encrypted by default.

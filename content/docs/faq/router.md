title: "What is the difference between a router and an antenna?"
---
Most of the devices we use, such as a LiteBeam or NanoStation are self-contained so they have an antenna, radio and ethernet router all in one. "Wireless router with antenna" is too long so we usually call the whole thing a router, just like your home wifi "router". Sector antennas usually have a separate radio plugged into the back of them so we call those antennas (although some sectors are self-contained). 

Ubiquiti call their self-contained AirFiber a "radio", and others call an AirFiber a router or an antenna, so yes everyone is confused about what term to use.

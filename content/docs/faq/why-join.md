title: "Why should I join the mesh now?"
---
By joining the mesh you help us grow and increase our reach across the city. This is a community project and you will be helping to create a decentralized infrastructure, free from traditional business interests.

You can also help your neighborhood by providing access points for local parks, cafes and bars. Local businesses are often keen to host a node once you explain the benefits to them.

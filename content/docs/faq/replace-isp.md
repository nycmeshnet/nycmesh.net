title: "Is this a replacement for my current internet connection?"
---
We are connected to the internet through peering at an internet exchange point. If you have line-of-sight to supernode1 in downtown Manhattan, or supernode2 in Brooklyn you can have a fast, reliable connection with suitable hardware, and replace your ISP.

Many members who cannot connect directly to our supernode are sharing their internet. If you have line-of-sight to another member or they are very close by you can ask if it is OK to share internet. We encourage people to share or make deals with their neighbors. If you are within range of the mesh, your router will automatically use the fastest internet connection.

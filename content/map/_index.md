This map shows our node locations. The colored markers are active nodes. The gray markers are node requests from our [join form](/join). We are working to turn these into active nodes by increasing our rate of installs.

The light-blue dots are public access points (LinkNYC kiosks) that can be used as gateways. The blue lines are over-the-air connections. The gray lines are speculative connections.

We are very interested in finding people from other parts of the city that are willing to build and maintain networks for their neighborhood! We will give you lots of help in this. If you would like to volunteer for your neighborhood please [email us](mailto:contact@nycmesh.net).
